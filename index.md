Hi, I'm [Renato](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rgusani/). Final Year [<strong>BSc Data Science</strong>](https://github.com/renatogusani/BSc-Data-Science) Student at the National College of Ireland.

Previously, I was a Cybersecurity Intern @Dell Technologies, from Feb 2022 - Aug 2022. Over the course of these 6 months I worked remotely for the Limerick, IE, Security & Resiliency Organization within the Cyber Defense Data-Protection team, on a variety of tools, such as [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/), [Imperva](https://www.imperva.com/), & [McAfee Solidcore](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/data-sheets/ds-application-control.pdf).

Currently, I am working on my Final Year Project - [<strong>SpaceXplorer</strong>](https://spacexplorer.info/). In this project, I explore the [Unofficial SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) & [Official NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov) with Data Science and provide a framework where you can also explore the data with your own analysis.
