Hi, I'm [Renato](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rgusani/). Final Year [<strong>BSc Data Science</strong>](https://github.com/renatogusani/BSc-Data-Science) Student at the National College of Ireland.

Previously, I was a Cybersecurity Intern @Dell Technologies, from Feb 2022 - Aug 2022. Over the course of these 6 months I worked remotly for the Limerick office, within the Data-Protection team on a variety of tools, such as [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/), [Imperva](https://www.imperva.com/), & [McAfee Solidcore](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/data-sheets/ds-application-control.pdf)

Currently, I am working on my Final Year Project - [<strong>SpaceXplorer</strong>](https://github.com/renatogusani/SpaceXplorer). In this project, I explore the unofficial SpaceX API with Data Science and provide a framework where you can also explore the data with your own analysis.
