description: >
  This assignment involved the usage of a publically accessible dataset from a specified source to create a report that included a number of effective 
  visualisations to highlight underlying patterns in the dataset as well as a narrative about the dataset's subject. I'll also have to develop and build a 
  poster using an infographic program to convey summary information from the dataset.
