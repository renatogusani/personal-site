description: >
  In this assignment, I must locate a good dataset for a supervised machine learning issue (e.g., classification or regression). 
  The dataset must fulfill the following requirements: 
  Attributes that are both category and numerical. 
  Include missing values (as some datasets may not have missing values the lecturer will provide code that you should run to randomly introduce some missing values). 
  be somewhat large (e.g., at least hundreds of instances). 
  The dataset should be fresh to me (e.g., it should not have been used in labs/resources mentioned by the lecturer, it should not have been used in a prior assessment for a different module, etc.).
