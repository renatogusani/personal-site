  I will have chosen and analyzed a dataset of my own. The dataset should be sourced ethically, and the I should demonstrate that they have the legal right
  to use it by completing the Ethics Declaration Form and submitting it as part of the project. There are no maximum or minimum constraints on the number 
  of records or variables in the data collection. Any subject may be used to create data sets. However, I was not allowed to utilize any data sets that 
  had already been used in class or in previous projects.
