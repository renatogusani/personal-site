title: 'MySQL Movie Database'
caption: Intro to Data Modelling & Databases \| Year 1 Semester 2
description: >
  The goal of this project is to design, install, and maintain a database system using an appropriate database package as a solution 
  for the business to handle data management concerns by offering value-added reporting utilizing sophisticated SQL programming abilities. 
  A real-life situation may be explored using assumptions that offered a knowledge of an organization's difficulties and requirements 
  and work my way through the High Level modelling, physical design, and queries of a DBMS solution. This project's talents will be useful 
  in the function of a DBMS specialist. I will be able to depict the design models (ERD diagram) using Microsoft Access or an equivalent tool, 
  and I will also have access to MySQL Workbench for DBMS implementation.
