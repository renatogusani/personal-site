description: >
  I was needed to create a portfolio in LaTeX and utilize a version control system 
  (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab) to store and track portfolio modifications. 
  The version control system should be widely used during the portfolio's development; merely uploading the final version into the 
  version control system is not appropriate.
