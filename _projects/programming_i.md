**Program 1:** 
Created a Python program to play the Hangman game. 
In the game of Hangman, the software provides a hint word (e.g. elaborate) that the player must guess letter by letter. 
The player makes one letter guess at a time until the complete word is revealed/guessed. The player may only guess 6 letters incorrectly before losing 
the game. In my approach, I should use the input() function to obtain the player's input.
