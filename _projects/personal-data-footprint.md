title: 'Personal Data Footprint'
caption: Hypothetical data science study on my personal data footprint
description: >
    In this project, I identify the relevant sources of my own personal data footprint, their characteristics, and their organizational structure (without                actually supplying the data), and I create an ethical review form for a hypothetical data science study on the personal data footprint. The essential phases of either KDD technique are linked to this study. 

The focus is on how I make sure that the proposed study complies with all applicable laws, ethical guidelines, and, if necessary, legal frameworks. I also observe the reduction of participation hazards. I provide a Declaration of Ethics Consideration and Ethical Review Application Form with all the information listed above.
