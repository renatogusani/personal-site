title: 'Programming I | Python'
caption: Programming I \| Year 2 Semester 1
description: >
  The goal of this project is to design, install, and maintain a database system using an appropriate database package as a solution 
  for the business to handle data management concerns by offering value-added reporting utilizing sophisticated SQL programming abilities. 
  A real-life situation may be explored using assumptions that offered a knowledge of an organization's difficulties and requirements 
  and work my way through the High Level modelling, physical design, and queries of a DBMS solution. This project's talents will be useful 
  in the function of a DBMS specialist. I will be able to depict the design models (ERD diagram) using Microsoft Access or an equivalent tool, 
  and I will also have access to MySQL Workbench for DBMS implementation.

* *Program 1:* * 
Created a Python program to play the Hangman game. 
In the game of Hangman, the software provides a hint word (e.g. elaborate) that the player must guess letter by letter. 
The player makes one letter guess at a time until the complete word is revealed/guessed. The player may only guess 6 letters incorrectly before losing 
the game. In my approach, I should use the input() function to obtain the player's input.
