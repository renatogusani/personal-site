      Renato was a stand out intern at Dell 2022. He was engaged from Day 1, always enthusiastic and always willing to help. 
      He got involved in as many activities as he could and was a go-to for the intern core team when we needed a volunteer. 
      Renato was a sociable, energetic and hard working intern. I would love to work with him again in the future.

      I was one of the managers at Dell with interns that were part of the same intake as Renato. This meant that whilst Renato did not report directly to me, we had many interactions during his internship.
      Throughout the internship Renato was extremely focused and was always ready to take the lead. He was a leader in conversations and was not afraid to share his thoughts. My impression of Renato was that he really maximised his time at Dell and got involved in every opportunity.
      I look forwards to seeing what Renato does with his career and where he goes!
