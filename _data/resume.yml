      Renato was a stand out intern at Dell 2022. He was engaged from Day 1, always enthusiastic and always willing to help. 
      He got involved in as many activities as he could and was a go-to for the intern core team when we needed a volunteer. 
      Renato was a sociable, energetic and hard working intern. I would love to work with him again in the future.
